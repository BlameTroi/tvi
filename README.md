# tvi -- troi's mini vi

Because I always wanted to ...

Starting from the final version of kilo from working through the
tutorial at https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/ take the
editor into a more vi like direction. Modal, similar key interface,
and so on.

Objectives:

* learn the code
* get used to c, a language I avoid
* learn to use vscode
